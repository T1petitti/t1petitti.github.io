          <h4>Meteor Data Filterer: </h4>
            <p>Developed in Python for a Software Engineering Course, 
            this program takes established data of over 20,000 meteors in a txt file and prompts the user
            for filters and output options.</p>
          <h4>Jobs Data Extractor: </h4>
            <p>Working with API keys and databases, this project developed for the CS
              capstone class searches Google for job postings and inserts specific data about the job into a large database.</p>
          <h4>Paycheck Predictor: </h4>
            <p>Mostly for convenience when creating a work schedule, this program developed in Java 
              prompts the user with a weekly schedule GUI. To use the program, they click and drag the amount 
              of hours they can work each day in a week and then inputs their hourly rate. The result is their 
              expected weekly paycheck. This is useful as money may be an important factor when choosing your schedule at work.
            </p>
          <h4>Pong: </h4>
            <p>Recreated the classic 1970's game, Pong, using Java's JFrame and JPanel interfaces.
               Created Keyboard Event Handlers to move the left and right paddles, as well as logical operators for
              if the ball touches the boundaries. Movement is simulated with an x and y velocity and refreshing the canvas to 
              create the next frame of the ball.</p>
          <h4>Momentum Physics Engine: </h4>
            <p> Using what I learned in my Physics 1 course, I developed a small Momentum physics engine using visualized objects
              with weights and velocities. When the objects collided together, their new velocities would be calculated using momentum equations.
            This served as both a nice practice for CS, as well as a nice visualization for Physics. </p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Final Project Idea</h2>
        <h4>Co-star Connections: </h4>
          <p>A program which filters movies based on the actors or actresses 
            that have worked together in them. For example, I want a Jim Carrey movie, 
            my gf wants a Jennifer Aniston movie, we see if they are casted in any movies 
            together. (Bruce Almighty)</p>
          <p> This may be possible by using API data to extract cast information from IMDB.
            Using Javascript, we can create filtering functions on any number
            of parameters (actors) to find relevant movie cast information.
          </p>
          <p> The interface would be somewhat spider-web-like, searching for known celebrities
            from a database, dragging their name onto the screen and connecting costars to find 
            relevant movies, or lack thereof.
