        <h1>Welcome to my first Webpage</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            My name is <strong>Tyler Petitti</strong>
            and I am a senior at <strong>Bridgewater State University.</strong> 
            I started in 2020 as a freshman Accounting student.
            By the end of sophomore year, I decided Accounting 
            wasn't the best for me so I transferred into the <strong>Computer Science</strong> Department.
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting as a junior to the end of my senior year,
            I have been taking as many computer science courses as possible,
            so I may graduate in 2024 without impacting my learning.
            I'm proud to say that, although I have handled an overwhelming amount of information
            on Linux, C, Routers, and git, I am graduating on time.
        </p>
        <p>
            It certainly wasn't easy nor was it convenient, but the challenge supplied me with
            information from each course that was helpful and relevant for all of my courses.
            I'm excited to continue pushing myself to multitask and learn multiple skills so that
            I'll have a strong structure of understanding for my career.
        </p>
        <h2>Other Fun Information</h2>
        <p>
            As for my engagement on campus, <strong>I work at the IT desk in the Maxwell Library.</strong>
            I have been working there since Sept 2022 and I thoroughly enjoy what I do.
            Most of my time is spent troubleshooting student's Authenticator apps or fixing Network issues.
            IT is a branch of the tech-field I enjoy and hope to continue pursuing.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also involved as the <strong>Programming Director of Program Council</strong> on-campus.
            We host the weekly events you see on campus, as well as Spirit Week, Homecoming, and other big events.
            Most of my time at BSU is spent planning and setting up these events each week on behalf of the school.
            Any information about upcoming events can be found on the insta (@bsupc), on EngageBSU, or from our
            weekly meetings at 5pm every Tues in RSU 201.
