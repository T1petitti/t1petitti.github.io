        <h2>Feb 18th, 2023 - 24 Hour Challenge</h2>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p> All of this, just because I decided to lay on the floor in Izzy's room. I stayed over and so we started the 
                24 hour challenge. We slept on the floor and 
                avoided the feet from above us. Neither of us slept, we just talked and goofed all night
                long and when it was finally morning we got mcgriddles. Because we were so tired, we
                then slept all day together. At 4pm, we got out of bed and got Chic-Fil-A, our first "Date". I took the best pic of you.
                Afterward, we went back to my dorm and watched some impractical jokers and napped some more.
                I'm so lucky I happened to lay on the floor with you.

        <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p> This was the day we were looking for green things for the St. Paddys Day parade.
                We went to Itzaparty and then later, Panera. I had fun hangin out with you because 
                you were just so funny and photogenic. That night, we decided to try and find some fun on campus.
                While we were in the dorm, we were only really talking to eachother. You promised me 
                a kiss if I tied your shoes. That was such a great and important night. In the morning, 
                we weren't able to discuss our relationship going forward because you had the parade. But 
                we both knew what we wanted.

        <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p> This was the day we officially started dating. I had already called you my girlfriend
                to Andrew and others but I wanted to do an official proposal. I had bought a Grogu easter basket
                and filled it with your favorite candies and pictures of us. We drove to Texas Roadhouse but since
                it was so busy, I had decided to just ask you out in the parking lot. I was so happy and lucky you had 
                said yes. We went to Olive Garden instead and they treated us as if they knew we had just
                started dating. Days later, I took this nice picture of you at the Plymouth Rock. I remember thinking 
                that I was taking a picture of my girlfriend. Not just Katelyn.

            <p> Remember that time we went to Stonehill and played with slime? I remember being nervous 
                to meet your friends kind of "officially". I didn't want to embarrass you, being your 'new' 
                'BSU' boyfriend. Even though it was just slime making and it was really gross and sticky, we 
                made our own fun just as we always do. Doesn't matter what we do, as long as I'm with you.

            <p> If you remember, this was my screensaver for a while. You with your hot dog at Five Guys. I thought it was
                so cute when you would get a hot dog everytime we went out or when you would want me to cook you one. 
                I just love how authentic you are, it really shows in your pictures. Always smiling and pretty. I'm proud 
                to show you off when we eat at restaurants. Thats my girlfriend with the Hot Dog. Yup, one cheesy roll up please, 
                don't forget the baja.

        <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p> This was around the time I had met your family. They wasted no time getting me adjusted to the dynamics of the family.
                They were quick and clever with their jokes and they were slyly interrogating me to make sure I was a good fit for you. 
                It's sweet that they cared so much about protecting you and making sure you're happy with me. I'm glad I passed the tests 
                and as a reward, your mom made me my own buffalo chicken calzone. It was literally the bomb. Thank you Rosie, I still 
                think about it.

        <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p> This was such a sweet date. One of the first times we actually planned a nice day together. 
                You looked so pretty in your dress and the pictures came out so cute. I remember the art being very cool too, stolen painting
                mystery. Afterward we had mid pizza but because I was a dik earlier in the day, I wanted to surpise you and 
                get Boston Burger Company. The shakes were pretty fire. Maybe i'll give Boston Burger Company another 
                shot some day. Sweet Date with a Sweet Girl. Im so lucky to be with you.

            <p> Trigger Warning. I regret prioritizing so much of my energy this summer in the wrong things. AeroBoost and Peaceful Play, 
                although stupid, showed me that you are patient and kind and are encouraging of me and my goals. But what I remember most is 
                being with you at the Charlie Horse, goin to Best Buy, and going to my Aunts house together (Even if I was on my phone the 
                whole time). Nevertheless, I love you and your ability to be supportive through hard or easy times.

            <p> This was such a special time. I had so much fun planning this and having you meet my family more. 
                We reference Disney so much and it was my favorite vacation I've ever had. It wouldn't have been possible without 
                you. I loved our hotel room, and going to Disney Springs, carrying all your stuff because you got sweaty 
                so easily. Ranking goes Hollywood Studios, Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, Epcot. At least for me. I can't wait to 
                go back someday together. But not anytime soon, that john was expensive.
