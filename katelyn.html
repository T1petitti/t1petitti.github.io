        <h2>&nbsp;To my Lady,</h2>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Happy Valentines Day, Katelyn. It has been such a pleasure being
            your boyfriend for the 11 months that we have been together. I hope you are content
            with my creative solution to a valentines day card. I've been very happy being with you, I feel
            like I can be myself and its so easy to communicate with you because you are so caring and thoughtful.
            I know I can be difficult, to say the least, but I appreciate how we always find a way to find humor 
            in the situation. You deserve so much, much more than I can ever give you. Whether we are eating Taco Bell,
            watching Wrestling or Mia Maples, doing Wordle, Connections, or the Mini together, I just love 
            spending time with you honey. Being with you has given me a much better understanding to what it 
            means to be in a relationship. I want to be with you and I want to make you happy.
        </p>
        <p class=text-center>You are my best friend, my love, my girl, my Katelyn. I love you. </p>
